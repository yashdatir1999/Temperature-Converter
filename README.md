# Temperature Converter

I've created a Temperature Converter using React.js that seamlessly converts Celsius to Fahrenheit.
The user inputs the temperature in Celsius, triggering an instant conversion to Fahrenheit. 
React's state management ensures real-time updates, providing a smooth user experience.
The code optimally utilizes React components and state hooks to enhance modularity and maintainability
